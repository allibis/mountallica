# aurdown.sh


It's a simple script for **Arch Linux** that download, compile and install programs from the official repos or from **AUR** archives.
Just type in the terminal in the file directory`./aurdown` and write the package's name.

if you want you can put the file in your `$HOME` directory and create an alias in your .*rc file:
`alias aurdown='cd $HOME && sh aurdown'`
