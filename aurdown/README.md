# aurdown.sh


It's a simple script that download, compile and install programs in the AUR archives.
Just type in the terminal in the file directory`./aurdown.sh` and write the package's name.

if you want you can put the file in your home directory and create an alias in your .*rc file:
`alias aurdown='cd $HOME && sh aurdown.sh'`
